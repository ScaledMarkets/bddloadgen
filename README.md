# bddloadgen

## Project Status

Under active development.

## What the Load Generator Is For
There are two uses:

1. Performance testing.
2. Distributing functional tests across multiple test nodes (test machines or VMs)
in order to execute them more rapidly.

## What Are the Distinguishing Features?
Refer to the figure below.

![Figure 1: Overall setup](BDDLoadgen_Overall_Setup.png "Figure 1: Overall setup")

1. Performance test scenarios are defined in [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin).
As such, performance test
scenarios are fully scriptable. There is no “user interface”. A performance test
scenario is executed by invoking it under [JBehave](http://jbehave.org/).
2. The performance test scenario specifies how many Test Nodes (VMs) are needed
and those are created and provisioned automatically.
3. The actual tests that get run against the system under test are labeled
“User Tests” in the figure. The User Tests are also implemented with JBehave.
The scripts/code for these tests is moved to each Test Node when the Node is
provisioned (automatically). Each time a user test is executed it is run under
a separate Java class loader, for full isolation.


## Usage Procedure
1. Install the loadgen-java.jar in an HTTP repository.
2. Identify the JBehave tests (.feature files and step classes) that you wish to run, to generate load.
3. Create a performance “control” (.feature) file, written in Gherkin.
4. Implement the control file, in Java.
5. Run the control file, using JBehave.
6. Retrieve results

Each of these steps is explained below.

## Install LoadGenerator


## Identify JBehave tests


## Instrument the tests

### Add `timelogBeginTest` and `timelogEndTest` to each test
The TestRunner needs to know when a test has actually begun. It cannot know this
on its own, because tests are invoked by JBehave, and invoking a test actually
takes a significant amount of time; so in order to be as accurate as possible,
we must call a method at the beginning of each test, to notify the TestRunner
that a test has begun. This method is the timelogBeginTest method, in the utility
class `loadgen.TestRunnerUtil`:

```
@Given ("^that we have a headless browser available$")
public void do_given()
{
    TestRunnerUtil.timelogBeginTest();  // beginning of test
    ...
}
```

Similarly, we must notify the TestRunner when a test has completed. This is
done with the `timelogEndTest` method.

```
@Then ("^a successful response is returned$")
public void do_then()
{
    ...
    TestRunnerUtil.timelogEndTest();  // end of test
}
```

If `timelogEndTest` is never called due to some kind of exceptional condition,
the TestRunner will merely use the time at which the invocation of JBehave ends
for that test.

### Define timers, if desired
The TestRunner can not only record the time to perform a test: it can record more
granular time intervals that you define. For example, suppose you want to record
the times that tests take to perform a certain section of code. To do this, you
can define a timer called, say, “MyTimer”, and add timer begin and end calls like this:

```
@When ("^a headless client requests$")
public void do_when()
{
    ...
    TestRunnerUtil.timelogBegin("MyTimer");
    ...
    TestRunnerUtil.timelogEnd("MyTimer");
    ...
}
```

In this case, the TestRunner will record the time between these calls, for each test, and LoadGenerator will compute statistics for these times.

To add these times to the graph produced by the LoadGenerator, simply add a line as follows to the test scenario step (Java file),

```
myPerformanceRun.graphEvent("MyTimer");
```

This will cause the time interval between `timeLogBegin("MyTimer")` and
`timeLogEnd("MyTimer")` to be recorded as a data item, for each test, and these
data items will be graphed over time. (See the Javadocs for
`loadgen.controller.PerformanceRun.graphEvent`)

## Create performance .feature file

## Implement performance “control” file


### Define a performance test run

```
LoadGenerator.performanceRun("spike", (perfRun) -> {
perfRun.setFeaturesDirectory(
perfRun.setStepsJarPath(
perfRun.stepClass(
perfRun.useProfile(
});
```

## Implement control file

## Run control file

## Retrieve results
